          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, the main objective is to utilize p5.js's user interactivity. Though the events and manipulation of variable values, this project is meant to allow the user to interact with the website through using the sliders, buttons, and color picker. The inspiration of this project is mostly based around the "Mad Libs" book series, along with the many other site that allow customization of the user's size.

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Sliders To Change Background Color </li>
            <li>Replace the default words with your custom words to chagne the story</li>
            <li>Press the "Get A Random Score" button to get a randomly generatred score from 70-100</li>
            <li>Click On The Color Pickers to choose a color for the text and the text background</li>
            <li>Drag the shapes around the project to add more life to the design.</li>
            <li>You can left and right click on the mouse and see how the circle reacts to it.</li>

      <h3>Inspirations</h3>
      <p>
        From childhood experiences, the utilziation of a reader's creativity was captivating and allows for the reader to really put their skills in understand art and design. The <i>Mad Libs</i> series, for example, can allow the reader to create their own story through choosing their own words to create personalized narrative. <br>
        Knowing about how many more companies and platforms are pushing for a more creative outlet for many people, it helps push the concepts and ideals for a "designer-friendly" site to be created.
      </p>

      <h5>Other Inspriations</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
        <li>Youtube</li>
        <li>Sandbox Video Games</li>
        <li>Various Avant-Garde Designs</li>

      <h3>Concepts</h3>
      <p>
        The main designing element around this project is simulating the "Mad Libs" series of books. The project also plans on adding more options to allow the user to interact and design their own display of the story. The whole purpose is to push many users to push forward with their artistic skills and even give ideas for the user to make designs with. <br> <br>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to making a prototype for this project, there was mostly experimentation around the simpler aspects of the project, like the color sliders, or the color picker. There has been many struggles around placement of the elements and how to work certain aspects of each element. Many more options on interactivity would be later added here. <br> 
        This was an early testing phase in the p5js editor, where the elements of the project's concepts are being tested on their capabilities and how much more each element can change up the webpage. <br>
        The code was made from the "ground-up". With the help with many sources of code provided by the official p5 site. <br><br>
        Provided below are screenshots of the old prototype (along with the link that leads you to the prototype), along with testing on the few elements of the site:

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Each feature shown here was both tested separately and together. They're separately tested to ensure their function are working properly. Having them tested out together allows an understand how each element works with each other.
      </p>

      <h3>Final Design</h3>
      <p>
        When making the final design for this project the purpose was to add many appropriate changes to the site, adding more options to the design. This final iteration now allows the users to drag and move around the shapes at the lower half of the project, while also making a new narrative with them. The user also now has the ability to change the background color of the passage the user is creating, and also allows the user to view the specifics of the colors, like <code>Hex Codes</code> and <code>RGBA Codes</code>. <br> <br>
        Provided are screenshots of the final, finished p5 sketch:
