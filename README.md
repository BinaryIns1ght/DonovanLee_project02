This project utilize p5.js through the users utilizing sliders, a button, and even various text input spaces. 

The user can edit the text inputs to create their own narrative to the story. The button can create a randomly-generated number from 70-100. 

There are sliders that help edit the RGBA values of the background color, while there's color pickers to change the text color.

You can even create a visual storytelling narrative with simple shapes and even emojis.
